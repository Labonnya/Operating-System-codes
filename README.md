Folder Description: Threading Problems Code

This folder contains the implementation of threading problems that commonly arise in concurrent programming, including the First Reader-Writer Problem, Second Reader-Writer Problem, Third Reader-Writer Problem, and Producer-Consumer Problem. These problems highlight synchronization challenges in multi-threaded environments and provide solutions to ensure thread safety and data integrity.

1. First Reader-Writer Problem:
The First Reader-Writer Problem focuses on managing concurrent access to a shared resource between multiple readers and a single writer. The code in this folder presents a solution that allows multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously while preventing writers from accessing the resource until all readers have finished. This ensures data consistency and avoids conflicts between readers and writers.

2. Second Reader-Writer Problem:
The Second Reader-Writer Problem extends the challenge by prioritizing writers over readers. In this scenario, if a writer is waiting to access the resource, no new readers are allowed to access it. The code in this folder provides a solution that allows multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously but ensures that writers have exclusive access, maintaining data consistency and preventing starvation of writers.

3. Third Reader-Writer Problem:
The Third Reader-Writer Problem introduces the concept of writer starvation prevention. It focuses on ensuring that writers are not indefinitely delayed in accessing the resource even if there are ongoing read operations. The code in this folder addresses this problem by implementing a solution that prioritizes writers once they request access, balancing fairness between readers and writers.

4. Producer-Consumer Problem:
The Producer-Consumer Problem involves coordination between multiple producer threads and consumer threads accessing a shared buffer. The code in this folder tackles this problem by implementing a solution that allows producers to add data to the buffer and consumers to retrieve data from the buffer, ensuring synchronization, proper data handling, and preventing issues such as data race or buffer overflow.

These threading problems represent common challenges in concurrent programming and require careful synchronization and coordination between threads to maintain data integrity and prevent conflicts. The code in this folder provides practical implementations of solutions to these problems, allowing developers to understand and apply effective multi-threading techniques for solving synchronization challenges in their applications.
